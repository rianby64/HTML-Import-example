# HTML-Import-example

This is an example about how to use the mentioned technology. Bear in mind that [Firefox is against this technology](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/12/mozilla-and-web-components/). So, don't implement at production.

## Atention

Don't use this thing at production. HTML-Imports is based on a draft. So, there's no guarranty that all they wrote will be implemented soon correctly in every browser or engine.
